# HMP_practicalMEEG
Supporting files and slides for the workshop on hidden multivariate pattern at practicalMEEG2025


Time and place: The session will start at 14.30 on Thursday 30th of October, and take place using the platform provided by practicalMEEG for which you have or should receive instructions. If you didn't receive the instructions or any link by Thursday 13.30 please send me an email so that I can send you the invite for that specific session.

Organization:The session is decomposed into a 1-hour lecture and around an hour for the tutorials and the hands-on part. Feel free to attend only one or both.

Installation: In order to follow the second part you need to have HMP installed so please follow the instructions here: https://hmp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html
I recommend you clone the entire repository (https://github.com/GWeindel/hmp) using `git`. If you're not familiar with git you can just use the `pip install` command in the link above. I will send a link to a folder just before the start of the session, be sure to have it downloaded at the session start.

More ressources (completely optional): If you wish to read about the method prior to the event you can see the documentation here (https://hmp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and read the paper on the method here: https://direct.mit.edu/imag/article/doi/10.1162/imag_a_00400/125469/Trial-by-trial-detection-of-cognitive-events-in
